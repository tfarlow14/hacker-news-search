This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The app will initialize on the ```/search``` page.

The ```/search``` page will clear when navigating to the history page.

The ```/history``` page will persist across app navigation but not browser refresh.
